# Computer_Vision

[Notebook1](4,7)
- Feature detection using Harris corner, SIFT, SURF
- Feature matching using NNC(normalised cross-correlation), NNDR(nearest neighbor distance ratio)
- Object instance recognition(find images of the same object)
- Scale-space blob detection

[Notebook](8)
- Face tracking / Moving object tracking

[Notebook](9,10,11)
- Camera calibration
- Stereo matching
- 3D reconstruction
- Structure from motion

12
Image classification with Neural Network
[Notebook2](5,6)
- Line detection and fitting using RANSAC and Hough transformatio
- Panoramic Image Stiching

Use an environment with the following opencv versions to avoid SIFT patent issue in later versions:
pip install opencv-python==3.4.2.16
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16
